                                Identify your viewers and plan accordingly.
                                
                                Before you start on any marketing plan, the first and foremost step is to identify the customer's behavior pattern. As the customers are the end-users, who engage with the videos and make them go viral. Similarly, when you are planning for video marketing, you have first to see, 
                                
                                Who is my target audience?
                                What are their interests that can be included in the video?
                                What are the already viral videos song your customer base?
                                What are the platforms where videos can quickly get viral?
                                What are the latest marketing or social trends?
                                
                                  
                                
                                Apart from the above factors, the budget to be invested and the time required to perform various digital platforms for a video to go viral is also necessary to be evaluated beforehand.
                                
                                You must keep some buffer in the budget, as things may turn out differently when you upload and create your video.
                                
                                You must be thinking, why are we talking about the "expected-engagement-outcome-rate" of videos instead of going full-throttle on "how to plan viral videos."
                                
                                It is indispensable to set realistic expectations from your created videos. You might need to create two or more than a hundred videos before you start getting any acknowledgment among your specified customer base.
                                
                                For example,
                                
                                Viral FAUG Game Official Trailer
                                
                                Due to international conflicts, the Indian Government banned the famous PUBG game, which was highly popular among India's gamers between 15 and 25.
                                
                                The next day of PUBG being banned in India, the FAUG game's official trailer video was launched on Youtube by the nCORE in India.
                                
                                And the trailer of FAUG went viral in a few minutes among the gamers of PUBG as the nCORE very well analyzed the market gap. It launched its video at the right time and to the right target audience and yield high engagement on their trailer video of FAUG.
                                
                                  
                                Create a roadmap for your video.
                                
                                
                                For any video to go viral following are the factors that can either boost the chances for any video to go viral or can be the biggest roadblock hindering your video from going viral :
                                
                                The Length of the video
                                The message or subject of the video
                                Timing at which you should reveal your message in your video
                                
                                
                                What is the Ideal Length of a video? 
                                
                                Whether or not the viewers of your video-type are habitual of watching long or short videos concerning the subject of your video or the video's content will be a very high factor deciding the watch-time of your video.
                                
                                For example, if you create an educational video on a challenging subject, your viewers are probably habitual of watching half an hour or one hour-long video.
                                
                                If you are creating a satirical video or some fun DIY, creating shorter videos between 3 to 5 minutes will be the best choice.
                                
                                Also, the video should not be so slow as viewers would fast forward it and skip it, and it should not be that fast that the message is not translated well.
                                
                                For any video to go viral, vast numbers of viewers are required to watch the entire video. But, if the viewers are bouncing off to other engaging content, that can positively impact your chances of ever going viral.
                                
                                How can the subject of videos impact their performance on social media?
                                
                                The highly relatable messages or subjects can help you with maximum video retention rate and video engagement rate.
                                
                                So, to chalk out the better performing subjects or messages in your industry, you have to analyze your competitor's video campaigns.
                                
                                For example, the social messages on the devotion of motherhood are famous. And any industry can associate with it and create viral content. While the tutorial subjects on cooking, home decor, Powerpoint, Adobe Photoshop, and other topics need thorough research, not all the issues are well received.
                                
                                
                                What is the ideal time at which you must introduce the message of your video, in video?
                                
                                In the DIY videos, introducing the video's subject in the first three seconds of your video can highly increase your watch-time. But, there's no point in the cinematic-short-stories-videos to expose your subject or message in the first three seconds as that will eventually make the viewer lose interest.
                                
                                The message of a video and the timing at which the message is revealed in a video is undeniable. These two factors get the viewers engaged in the video for a long duration and share the video on the digital platforms, eventually making it viral.
                                
                                
                                Quality content
                                
                                It is no brainer that the videos should be of exceptional quality and professionally produced.
                                
                                The script, visual appeal, video quality, sound quality, lighting, etc., everything should be of top-notch quality. 
                                
                                Today we have excellent and brilliant gadgets all around us, and our audiences are habitual of watching high-quality content. So, you cannot expect them to style for less.
                                
                                Hence, we content creators can not give any excuse for shaky, hazy, blurry, poorly lit acoustics, or videos with disturbances. We sometimes try to save ourselves from editing or formatting the videos. But that can kill the crucial flow of the videos, which otherwise would have made a very engaging video.
                                
                                If not fancy gadgets, you can use your mobile phones too as they are not less than any DSLR with 48 and above megapixels.
                                
                                The video titled, "meet iPhone12 - Apple" was created by Apple company, unveiling their upcoming mobile phone, "iPhone 12". The video witnessed 2.1 crore views in mere ten days. And the secret sauce behind going viral was the exceptional and flawless quality of the video. Here is the link to the same video.
                                
                                https://youtu.be/65JrtwtTOdc 
                                
                                Invoke an emotion
                                
                                Creating viral videos is all about evoking emotions. Fortunately, we humans are a creature of our feelings.
                                And while creating videos, you have to consider and appeal to the emotions being present in your viewers just enough that your viewers are compelled to watch the video on loop, save it, and share it with their acquaintances. 
                                
                                So if you are creating a funny video, there must be some unstoppable giggles, or if you are creating sad videos, then the content must be heart-wrenching. 
                                
                                But, if you are making a tutorial or a recipe video, you should grab your users' attention so that they have full trust in you and your method of teaching.
                                
                                For example, the recent Ford ad launched around 2020 Diwali is just so apt, as it captures the story of a mother and her daughter.
                                
                                On the occasion of Diwali, when a daughter fails to visit her mother's house as she is injured, her old mother decides to drive the Ford car to her daughter's home, which is located far off, and an overnight journey all alone can be fatal.
                                
                                But, the old mother's adventurous journey eventually turns out to be very fruitful as she gets to unite with her daughter on the festive occasion of Diwali irrespective of the hurdles, all thanks to the new advanced and comfortable Ford Car.
                                
                                The title of the Ad claims, "Open Doors to a New Beginning." And that just fit very right with the complete story of mother and daughter duo.
                                
                                The video is just 1.50 seconds, and still, the message is not compromised and translated with utter clarity.
                                
                                This video has 3.4 crore views!!!
                                
                                And that's a huge number…. 
                                
                                Check out the link; I am sure you will be smiling at the end of the video.
                                
                                https://youtu.be/3MUoCW8EHL0 
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                Narrate a good story
                                
                                Video creation should not be focussed on creating 100% selling ads, as no one would want to see "Buy Now," "Diwali Dhamaka Sale," or "Limited Offers" ads all the time.
                                
                                As nowadays audiences have evolved and are too smart, they don't like to see too much boasting, bragging, and self-promotion; challenging sales strategies are outdated. 
                                
                                And such ads result from one-way thought processes, focused on just generating one-time revenue from customers rather than establishing long-term relationships with the clients, and are very cheap click baits that are highly ignored by potential customers.
                                
                                Instead, video ads should be created to draw audiences engaging and mind-blowing narratives that impact their mind. 
                                
                                So, selling something can be an underlined message. Still, the parallel focus must be on achieving high-quality engagement or impression on the customer's mind by telling a great story that will eventually make the video worth watching. 
                                
                                For example, take a look at this video, titled "80 years old couple working hard to survive|| best matar paneer ever|| they need our help".
                                
                                The video is about an old couple who is trying very hard to meet their ends. The video showcases their yummy Matar-Paneer recipe, and both the couple and the video creator made their plea to the viewers to support the Dhaba. 
                                
                                The video managed to garner around 32 lakh views. 
                                
                                The buzz created by this particular video was craved and shared all over India that all other video creators were running to Malviya Nagar to capture the old couple and their Dhaba. 
                                
                                They were claimed to fame on every news channel and had their hashtag #baba ka Dhaba. Kudos to the video creator's storytelling skills that his video could start a chain effect and help out the poor couple.

                                Give it a good opening
                                
                                The opening of the video must be perfect as the first 3 to 10 seconds decide whether the viewer would continue to watch your video or not. 
                                
                                Greet your audience warmly and explain what your video is about to showcase between the first 3 to 10 seconds of your video. 
                                The following can be a very effective way to open your video :
                                1.Address the Problem beforehand, then introduce the solution at the end or throughout the video.
                                2.Go Bold and start with an attention-grabbing hook such as a loud laugh, breaking of a glass, or a man jumping off the cliff; keep it relevant to your video.
                                3.Directly address your subject
                                4. Play with the camera or sound
                                
                                Just focus on what makes you watch a video for more than 3 to 10 seconds and inculcate those features in your video as per your video's subject and audience.
                                Think out of the box
                                
                                We all love watching videos on epic fails, or wedding fails, or funny fails, or bloopers of our favorite shows, or AFV videos, etc.;
                                
                                Such videos are highly entertaining and creative. When people are amusing themselves on social media, they love to watch content that will lighten their mood. 
                                
                                A little surprise element or something unexpected in your videos will engage and entertain your audiences throughout their videos. It is imperative to engage and entertain your viewers to increase your video's retention and watch time.
                                
                                  The title, "paragliding India funny video | scared man | very funny must watch till the end," is self-explanatory and illustrative of what the video is all about. A simple paragliding video might interest very few people, but this video succeeded in garnering 82 lakhs views. 
                                
                                All because of how the video turns out to be obnoxiously hilarious and engaging as it progresses. ttps://youtu.be/OEkqzREtGKE

                                People click on interesting, entertaining, and valuable content.
                                And people judge whether or not the content is good enough to watch based on thumbnails, captions, and the video's subject.
                                
                                The trio of thumbnail, caption, and title of any video creates the first impression. These are the only visible parts of a video when a user scrolls through their social media feed or searches for the desired video.
                                
                                The thumbnail of your video must be too good to be ignored. As depending on how compelling clickbait you have on your videos, CTR will behave high or low for your videos. High CTR ensures that your video will rank high and receive more traffic.
                                 The thumbnails must be smartly made; different combinations of images and text can be used, or impressive stills of video can also be used as thumbnails. The title must trigger curiosity in the viewer and clearly state what to expect from the video.
                                
                                
                                Do the aftermath
                                
                                Today, all the social platforms provide insights regarding the performance of video content posted by video creators.
                                
                                The critical parameter to take note of while analyzing the performance of your video are :
                                
                                Watch time
                                CTR
                                Video retention rate
                                Video engagement rate 
                                Age Group
                                Demographic
                                Gender
                                
                                Study the parameters of each video you have published on the internet and create videos that will perform well.
                                
                                But, always make sure to very well market your video to receive as much traffic as possible.
                                
                                All of the above points will help you create viral videos.
